# Wildlife Knowledge Graph (of China)
## This is a project under construction. We have selected multiple authoritative data platforms as the main data sources. Specifically, we selected online databases such as the "List of Chinese Biological Species" (2024 edition), the Species Diversity Data Platform, the Chinese Animal Theme Database, and the Wildlife Diversity Detection Image Data Management System, as well as authoritative literature such as "Fauna Sinica" and "Flora Sinica". These data sources not only cover rich species information, but also provide detailed classification information, distribution areas, growth habits, habitats and other multi-dimensional data.
## Now, we open the taxonomy level triple, which will be the backbone of the wildlife knowledge graph.

## The specific statistics of the species are as follows:

Item     | #Num
-------- | -----
Kingdom  | 3
Pyhlum  | 35
Class  | 122
Order  | 591
Family | 3065
Genus  | 21982
Species | 149139
